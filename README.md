# coolweather
CoolWeather is a project in my first Android-developing book(第一行代码) written by Lin Guo.
Of course, in fact the APP's name is ToWeather, which I like to call it "今天气".
But it can only be used to report the weather in China, when I get enough money to get a better API, undoubtly I will make it work for the world.
You can find the APK in the APK catelogue.
